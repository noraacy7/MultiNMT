" Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety "
On the occasion of the " Valentino : Master of Couture , " an exhibition that opened this week in London , ABC speaks with Naty Abascal , Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other of the Italian designer's famous clients .
Somerset House , former home of Queen Elizabeth I of England , is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting a Valentino Garavani exhibition .
During the inauguration of " Valentino : Master of Couture , " the designer acknowledged a retrospective apotheosis that brings together over 130 couture gowns created by his fashion house over the past 50 years .
" I love this palace " he says , in his unmistakable Italian accent .
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is " signore " Garavani , although it could not have been written without his distinguished clients .
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rarefied and distant world of the nobility .
In the first room of the exhibition , open until March 3 , there are a number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of aristocracy , from Princess Salimah Aga Khan , Lord Snowdon , Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece to Margaret of England .
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as if they were trophies of his social ascent from humble couturier in Voghera , northern Italy , to idol of the international jet-set .
There is nothing wrong with loving royalty .
" At least they don't drop cigarette ends on your magnificent carpet , like some beautiful pop music celebrities do , " says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza .
In the '60s and '70s , we both lived in the Alps and were good friends .
Valentino is a spectacular host whose entertains with generosity and elegance .
" We all loved being invited to his chalet in Gstaad " says " Heini " Thyssen's ex-wife , a close friend of forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli and Eugenie Niarchos .
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety .
And yet , he is a star .
Valeria Mazza , wearing a Valentino .
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also recalls the couturier's charisma .
Many years ago , after a fashion show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome , we went for dinner at his flat .
There were twenty of us , including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr .
You could see and feel his " spirit " in every detail of the flat and its decor , the food and the music .
" All the guests were made to feel important and loved " recalls the top model , who started working with him during Haute Couture Week Paris , in 1995 .
" His designs are works of art and so never go out of fashion " she concludes .
Nobility parade
Garavani's life is not a story of obsession , but of well reciprocated love .
He loves well-educated people who come from good backgrounds , and they love him .
One of the Somerset House galleries has been transformed into a glamorous , sixty-foot long catwalk which offers a role reversal : visitors take the place of the models and have to parade down the catwalk while looking at a dream " audience " wearing Valentino masterpieces , for example , the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis , the costume Monica Vitti wore in " La Notte " and the wool and leather coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba .
In this crowd of mannequins , names stand out such as Sibilla of Luxembourg , Gloria von Thurn und Taxis , Mette-Marit of Norway , Rosario of Bulgaria and Sofia of Habsburg .
Naty Abascal and the designer , in 2006
Many of these clients say your first Valentino is like your first love , " impossible to forget . "
I remember it perfectly .
It was a pair of trousers , a shirt , a " gilet " waistcoat and jacket from the 1971-1972 autumn-winter collection .
" It was a gift he gave me " says Naty Abascal , one of the designer's muses .
" I prefer him to other designers because of his femininity , his great love of women , and because he enhances our beauty " added the former Duchess of Feria .
I love the colours he uses , they really stand out and " lend themselves " to your face .
Their proportions are perfect .
The princess and fashion advisor Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg also remembers the first time she wore a Valentino .
As a teenager living in Italy , I dreamed of reaching the age when I'd have the chance to wear one of his evening gowns . . .
My time finally came in the late '90s .
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party in the castle belonging to my cousin , Prince Edouard de Ligne .
It was a red dress , with a frilly skirt , draped " corsage " and a strapless neckline .
" It was a dream come true " says Princess D'Arenberg , the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg .
" Valentino is indifferent to fashion , his obsession is timeless " says this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris , New York and Buenos Aires .
Princess D'Arenberg looks after her couturier gowns with " the utmost care . . . because a dress not just a dress , it's also the many memories that go with it . "
The " king " of fashion
The " grand finale " of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress from her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995 .
It took four months' work and 25 " girls " ( as the designer calls his seamstresses ) to create the pearl-encrusted , ivory-coloured silk gown with twelve different types of lace and a train four and a half metres long .
According to journalist Suzy Menkes , the leading authority of the specialist press , that dress represents a high fashion milestone of the late 20th century , " the return of high society clients . "
Dazzled for years with the " savoir-Ãªtre " of the elite , Valentino is now its finest exponent .
Cavaliere di Gran Croce ( the highest-ranking distinction in Italy ) , Cavaliere del Lavoro , Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres , and awarded the Legion of Honour , Garavani accumulates as many honours as any of his clients' husbands .
" I've always been struck by his refined and calm manner , and his neat and perfect appearance " acknowledges D'Arenberg .
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum .
He was on the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes , a great friend of mine .
" He was immaculate , time stands still for him . "
If a princess says that . . .
The hardest job in the world : the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros , the Indonesian volcano porters risk life and limb carrying 70 kilos of sulphur along steep stone paths .
There are people for whom work is hell , and others who - literally - work in hell .
This is the case of Anto Wijaya , one of the 400 miners who make their living taking sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano , east of the Indonesian island of Java .
To do so , he has to descend every day to the bottom of the crater , where the sulphurous gas emanating from the bowels of the earth solidifies on contact with air .
After breaking off large sulphur rocks , which in total can weigh up to 70 kilos , he carries them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders along the steep stone paths .
It is only 250 metres to the top of the volcano , which rises to 2 , 386 metres above sea level , but the exhausted porters take over 40 minutes to get there , at snail's pace , keeping their balance and measuring their steps carefully to avoid slipping and falling over the precipice .
They know that one slip could cost them their lives , as happened to a French tourist who plunged to her death a few years ago on the hazardous Kawah Ijen cliffs .
The Kawah Ijen miners are paid 5 euro cents for each kilo of sulphur removed .
Once at the top , they make their way past the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and then , lugging their heavy baskets , they walk three kilometres to the scales installed by a mining company a little further down , 1 , 850 metres above sea level .
This is PT Ngrimbi Candi , a company which , since 1960 , has been exploiting the volcano , and quite literally its workers , whom it pays 662 rupees ( 5 euro cents ) per kilo of sulphur .
It then sells the sulphur for 10 , 000 rupees ( 83 cents ) to the petrochemical industry , as the mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used in the manufacture of matches , fireworks , cosmetics , dynamite and even for whitening sugar .
" We generally carry 70 kilos , so we get about 46 , 000 rupees ( 3 . 8 euros ) a trip " explains Anto , who usually make three trips a day .
Each one takes three hours and you end up exhausted , but it means he gets 138 , 000 rupees ( 11 . 5 euros ) at the end of the day .
Although it seems a pittance for such an inhuman effort , it is three times what he would earn in the field .
" Miners' wages are very high here , whereas coffee harvesting is paid 15 , 000 rupees ( 1 . 2 euros ) a day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees ( 167 euros ) " explains the porter , who previously worked as a mason in the island resort of Bali .
There , his wage was 75 , 000 rupees ( 6 . 2 euros ) a day and the work was not as hard , but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi , a village near the volcano , for a compelling reason which , in Indonesia , is as overriding as the sulphur : " I married a girl from Bali , where they are Hindu , and I've brought her to Java to convert to Islam . "
Anto has asthma , he has difficulty breathing , coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases .
At 27 years old , Anto has been risking his life for three years in the Kawah Ijen volcano , and the sulphur has already begun to take its toll on him , even though he covers his face with special mask and goggles .
He has asthma , he has difficulty breathing , coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases from the volcano .
This is the price you have to pay to realise your dreams .
" I'll go on working two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French " he vows in more than acceptable English .
Punished for life , this pleasant , intelligent young man could be a tour guide , waiter or hotel receptionist , but instead he does the work of a mule .
Sharing a filthy wooden hut with other porters , he gets up every day at two in the morning because the sulphur doesn't stop flowing at night , when its characteristic yellow colour turns blue and it glows in the dark .
Defying the shadows , Anto descends the crater and lights the path with a small torch attached to the helmet he bought with his money .
Some 400 porters carry sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the crater .
Despite their huge profits , the mining company has not mechanised the sulphur extraction process to save costs , nor has it provided any equipment for the porters , who work for themselves and by the kilo .
In fact , they do not even see any of the 30 , 000 rupee ( 2 . 5 euro ) per camera surcharge that , on top of the 15 , 000 rupee ( 1 . 2 euro ) entrance fee , the guards of this natural reserve charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and their human mules .
" This work is for animals , not people " protests Madrusin , a burly 42-year porter who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades , since leaving school .
He can lift up to 110 kilos , ensuring that he will go on working " all he can " because he needs the money to educate his three children , aged between 18 [months ? ] and 10 years old .
I won't retire , I'll die here because the volcano has been my whole life .
Although the sulphur burns your throat and stings your eyes when the wind suddenly changes and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano , they are so hardy that no-one complains of serious illnesses . . . apart , of course , from their common respiratory problems , osteoarthritis , knee pain and sores on the shoulders , which have been misshapen by the weight of the baskets .
Balancing the basket on his back , Unainik can only carry 50 kilos now he is 53 years old .
Every day , he and his fellow workers break off 15 tonnes of sulphur from the volcano , which three lorries move to the warehouse in Tamansari , 18 kilometres away along a goat path that passes through scrubland .
" I won't retire , I'll die here because the volcano has been my whole life " says Unainik , opening a mouth full of gaps where teeth use to be .
The oldest of his five children , 30 years old , also works carrying sulphur .
Time passes , but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation in one of the hardest jobs in the world : the one done by human mules in the Kawah Ijen volcano .
Singapore seeks babies to save its economy
Singaporeans blame their careers , stress and the cost of property and education for not having children .
" Singapore's population needs to grow . "
I'm a patriotic husband , you're my patriotic wife , let's do our civic duty and create life !
It may seem unlikely that these verses are part of an advert for mint sweets , but in spite of this - or perhaps because of it - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year .
The phrases are part of a rap and make use of local references such as " Let's put a bao ( bun ) in the oven " to make fun of the birth rate in Singapore .
The advertising company that made the video , BBH , is hopeful that the advertisement will manage to focus attention to the problem in a fun way .
Its creative director , Douglas Hamilton , says he wanted to use the power of music to make people perform their " national duty . "
It's purely an Internet thing , so we had to make it fun and amusing .
It's the biggest problem facing this country .
We are the world's worst at reproducing our own progeny , so we felt it was an issue we had to address .
We knew the Government had tried many things , like launching perfumes with pheromones or organising speed dating evenings .
Many of these ideas may have been creative , but they didn't necessarily work .
So we thought : why not be as creative as possible to solve the problem , by composing a rap ?
1 . 2 children
But the Singapore Government is not taking it so lightly .
It spends USD 1 , 300 per year on policies to encourage people to have more children .
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to USD 15 , 000 per child , extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits .
But this has all had little effect .
Singapore is a rich , high technology city State in Southeast Asia , also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls .
The birth rate in Singapore , according to its national population division , currently stands at 1 . 2 children per woman .
The last time it was over 2 , known as the replacement rate , was in 1976 .
So why are Singaporeans not having children ?
Tan Wei Ming , Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Division , said that it is a result of " better education " and " a wider range of career opportunities . "
" This has given people a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities , beyond getting married and starting a family " he explains .
These changes in social norms have contributed to increasing numbers of people who are single , and delaying marriage and births , which has resulted in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore .
Meanwhile , an EU immigration policy aimed at dramatically increasing immigration to cope with the population decline has created resentment among the local population .
In Singapore , there are websites where xenophobia against many new immigrants is widespread and thinly disguised , especially the Chinese who are criticised for keeping wages low and not integrating .
Increased immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why , last year , the Singapore ruling party experienced its worst election result since independence .
Since the election there has been an attempt to correct the problem , with the highest taxes and levies for foreign workers .
Unexpected consequences
While a fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation's economic growth , tax revenues , healthcare costs and immigration policies , in Singapore's case there are also some unexpected consequences .
The Government is trying not to build so many small houses .
For example , it has started to influence the real estate sector .
Its urban development authority has started to control the number of small apartments , known as " shoe boxes , " which can be built in certain areas of the city .
These apartments have a surface of 46 square metres and have been very successful in terms of sales .
However , there is concern that they may promote a single-living lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large family houses .
But , Lim Yew Soon , managing director of the real estate company EL Developers , says his " shoe boxes " sell much faster than larger units .
They are more popular , in the sense that the units sell days , even weeks , faster than larger units .
This means they are much better for our cash flow .
However , he admits that the new regulations give clearer guidance to developers , who previously had obstacles put in their way if they provided for too many small units in a project .
Too stressed
Singapore is a city State .
Although these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate , when talking to Singaporeans working in the central financial district , it seems they will not have much impact .
" People are very stressed , houses are expensive and so is education , so a lot of people are putting off having a family " says a young executive .
Other people can have children .
" But , for me , it is important to have my own money and time " says another young man of around 20 years old .
Men and women alike mention their careers , stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children .
So , much as the Government is trying to encourage its citizens to have children , when it comes to babies , the Singaporeans have the last word .
What is private offline is private online
Privacy .
According to the Spanish Royal Academy Dictionary , it means the quality of private life or " the level of privacy which a person is entitled to protect from any interference . "
What is privacy for an under 16 ?
How do you apply this definition to their daily life and social networks ?
Do they understand the dangers they are exposed to by airing information over the Internet which they probably would not share offline ?
ElPeriÃ³dico interviewed five children aged between ten and 15 years old who are frequent Internet users .
In four cases , they associated the term with " something very much mine " on a personal level , and " in the user name and password " when applied to social networks .
" I wouldn't upload my deepest secrets in a post " says Jorge , aged ten , when trying to explain the meaning of privacy on sites such as Facebook , Twitter , Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger , with which he has had accounts for two years .
" They are very secret secrets , I'll tell my mother , but not everybody " he says .
On FB I upload nice pictures or games .
And I have fun with people I know .
" I wouldn't share a photo that isn't mine , or that belongs to somebody who's doing something stupid " he says .
The child recognises that it is bad to post obscene pictures of naked people , crimes , or write humiliating or aggressive comments .
Jorge says he knows the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter .
Most are relatives .
His mother is included , and she has the password to one of the accounts .
I opened Twitter to express myself and post interesting tweets .
" I don't know if they answer me , I only upload them " he adds .
" Social networking is fun , I can talk quickly to relatives far away or my friends " he says .
He does not hesitate to reply that he would never accept a request from an unknown person .
Nor would he take any notice of someone who recommends a stranger to him .
The case of Joseph , aged 14 , is different .
This teenager has accounts with Hotmail , Facebook , My Space and Ask , and in the last case he admits not knowing 20 of the people added to his friends list .
" It doesn't bother me , because we have something in common , like music " he says .
The boy says that no-one has suggested anything to him or asked him for his home address or phone number .
" If they pressured me or asked me for it , I'd just delete them from my account " he states .
Joseph became a follower on Ask , after reading a recommendation on Twitter .
This teenager is not alien to experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying .
An acquaintance of a friend of mine was being pestered on a social network .
They were threatening him and demanding money from him .
" I never found out who it was " he says .
The victim , according to JosÃ© , did not close his account .
" He just made it private . "
He then explains a series of steps to configure the account safely .
Unlike Jorge , this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations .
I would do it if I didn't like somebody , or they made me want to do it .
" However , I know that's cyberbullying " he admits .
Key questions
Marielos Porras , an English teacher with a degree in Education and Learning , believes that to guide children and teenagers , they should understand that the purpose of social media is to inform .
" The Internet emerged as a means of searching for information , but with the appearance of these websites , the rules of the game changed " he says .
Porras says the scholar Marc Prensky , with a Master's degree in Education from Yale University and author of the work Digital Natives , Digital Immigrants , coined these terms to explain the phenomenon .
Digital natives are those children and young people born with technology .
" We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them , when we are still in fact learning " he says .
He says that the issue is complex , " because we are asking them to have a clear policy on what is appropriate or not to disclose , publish or divulge , at an age at which maturity is not conducive to this . "
" They also have to be selective when what matters most is to be popular and have thousands of friends , without thinking of the consequences " he adds .
According to the specialist , the most effective way to teach children and teenagers what privacy is , is through questions that make them think .
" Telling them not to do it is no good " he adds .
Porras then lists some options : There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger , so why do it online ?
Or , would you like a friend to publish a photo of you like the one you posted of a friend ?
Do you know what others publish about you ?
When tagging party photos , did you ask the other people's permission to tag them ?
And one more question : does everyone need to know what you're doing all the time ?
Another point is to make them see that they must behave online as they do offline .
The rules are the same .
" Outside the Internet , people act with respect , morality and other principles , so they should act the same way on social networks " he says .
Monitoring
Stuart Guard , a university professor , primary school teacher and educational consultant , says it is essential for parents to read social networks' policies thoroughly .
By understanding all the clauses , they have solid grounds to talk to their children about the implications of opening an online account .
" For example , the age at which you are allowed to share or publish " he says .
According to Guardia , it is important to remind children the " don't talk to strangers " lesson .
Unasur Summit closes without making public the Lima Declaration
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations ( Unasur ) concluded today in Peru without making public the Lima Declaration , previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven attendee leaders .
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the Sixth UNASUR Meeting of Heads of State and Government , but Presidential and Chancellery sources initially said they would deliver it after the summit closed , but later they claimed that it will be published at some point on the Peruvian Government website .
When asked about the text , they pointed out that the content had been disclosed by Peruvian President , Ollanta Humala , during a brief statement to the press .
Journalists' access to information from the Summit was restricted at all times .
During the summit , in the press room , only video was aired , with no sound , showing the presidential meeting with the message " closed session , audio restricted . "
The little information that circulated among reporters was given by the press spokesmen of some of the UNASUR governments attending the meeting , but not the Peruvian Government .
The only document released during the summit was the list of attending presidents , which angered hundreds of journalists from various national and international media , who asked for more details .
The Peruvian President then sent an email to the media with the " final statement " of the summit , but this was Humala's statement , and not the official document that closed the summit .
Last October , Peru hosted the Third Summit of South American-Arab Countries ( ASPA ) , and this time , despite repeated requests from the press , the previously announced Lima Declaration was again not made public .
The ASPA official website confirms that the document was published last Tuesday .
At both international events , the Peruvian authorities were at pains to ensure that there were broadcasting systems assured for all the journalists , but limited the obtaining of information to a maximum .
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Hague Court to adjudicate a border dispute between the two countries .
The Presidents of Peru , Ollanta Humala , and Chile , SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era , met during the regional event and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) , which on Monday , at The Hague , will start to hear the arguments of both parties , in the lawsuit Lima has filed against Santiago .
" We will obey and execute the order that currently defines the differences we are bringing before this international court " said Humala , together with his Chilean counterpart .
" Chile has been , is and will remain a country that respects international law and the peaceful resolution of disputes , treaties and international courts " added PiÃ±era , greeting Humala with a handshake , alongside the flags of the two countries .
Confirmation of both presidents that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia this week denounced the BogotÃ¡ Pact , whereby it accepted to submit to the judgement of this international court , following a decision on its maritime boundary with Nicaragua which it regarded as seriously flawed .
The summit was held with the absence of the Presidents of Brazil , Dilma Rousseff ; Venezuela , Hugo Chavez ; Bolivia , Evo Morales ; and Argentina , Cristina Kirchner .
Paraguay , which was suspended by UNASUR in 2011 after the dismissal of former President Fernando Lugo , was not involved in the meeting .
Host President Ollanta Humala was responsible for opening the session in the morning and closing the summit , just after noon in Lima .
The President read the final document which reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the action plans laid down for 31 projects between the South American countries , for a total of 17 billion dollars of investments .
Among the resolutions adopted , it was mentioned that UNASUR countries will take " important steps toward the goal of a South American citizenship , for which residence agreements are being extended . "
He reported that actions are being implemented to improve " cooperation in the fight against insecurity and transnational organised crime , actions to make medication more accessible , low-cost Internet access in all areas of South America , and to deal jointly and efficiently with risks of natural disasters . "
With Europe in crisis , " economic consolidation ( in Latin America ) should not have a triumphalist attitude but should serve to expand its productive matrix and glimpse a better future for its people " Humala added .
" We decided to focus on a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve connection among areas of South America , especially in rural and border areas . . . uniting our countries and creating new economic networks " said the Peruvian President in a message read out .
Among these projects , he mentioned that five are in Peru and are located in the transverse axes of its territory , between the coast and Brazil , and two focus on increased connection with Ecuador , although he gave no further details .
Also , the final document mentioned the political situation in Paraguay .
" We hope the electoral process in that country serves to reincorporate it in the Union of South American Nations , " from which it is currently excluded .
The need for Latin America to remain a prosperous , peaceful and integrated nation , with good neighbourly relations , was another issue highlighted by the summit .
In this sense , the President of Colombia , Juan Manuel Santos , said before attending the start of the regional event that he expected to meet with his counterpart from Nicaragua , Daniel Ortega , on Saturday in Mexico , to respectfully discuss the maritime dispute after the failure of the ICJ , questioned by Bogota .
" The day after tomorrow ( Saturday ) I might have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega " Santos said .
" We will review all these paths , [which] are not exclusive , and the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua " he emphasised .
" With President Ortega , I hope I can say that we handle this in the most civilised and respectful manner possible " said Santos .
Santos and Ortega are due to meet on Saturday in Mexico , where they expect to attend the inauguration of the country's new President , Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto .
Also , as part of the summit , the bloc's foreign defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan , which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region .
Argentina , Bolivia , Colombia , Ecuador , Peru , Brazil , Uruguay , Venezuela , Chile , Guyana , Surinam and Paraguay make up UNASUR , although the latter is currently suspended .
Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc .
" South America should learn from Europe to integrate citizenship " says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador , Rafael Correa , said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal that " South America , in this case , must learn from Europe . "
Correa , who took part in the Eleventh Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations ( UNASUR ) held in Lima , told Peru's state television that Europeans " killed one another in the Second World War " and other conflicts , " but are now practically one country . "
To this end , he defended the project to establish South American citizenship encouraged by member countries of UNASUR .
" We have to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers for any South American country , as is already the situation with members of the Andean Community . However , there are still reactionary sectors that want us to return to the past " he said .
The Ecuadorian President was also in favour of the restructuring of the Organisation of American States ( OAS ) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the Pact of San JosÃ© on human rights .
Those who speak with authority never commit to anything , whereas we South Americans sign everything .
" It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding " he said referring to Ecuador giving political asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange .
Correa said he does not regret that decision because with it he has not betrayed his principles , but has respected his " deep democratic and human rights values . "
He added that , at the time , " he had reasonable suspicion that Assange would be extradited to another country and that his case would not be respected . "
Additionally , he criticised the Swedish courts for demanding that he be subject to questioning for an alleged sexual offence in his country , when " Swedish legislation itself dictates that he can be questioned via videoconference , which could be done from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London . "
Correa said that there is a risk of deterioration of Assange's physical and mental health .
" I have not spoken to him since he was at our embassy , but the ambassador informed me that he had a minor lung problem , nothing serious " said the Ecuadorian President .
What there is , is the danger that his physical and mental health may deteriorate due to being locked in a small space without any outdoor exercise .
" That would complicate the health of any person " he added .
Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange in June by the Ecuadorian Embassy , in London , through the issue of a safe-conduct pass that permits travel to Ecuador , is in the hands of Great Britain , Sweden and the European legal authorities , and stressed that there have been talks with London to seek a solution to the imprisonment of the WikiLeaks founder .
We do not negotiate with human rights , we do not use that word in this case , but there have been ongoing discussions .
" The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain , Sweden and the European legal authorities , because Assange's lawyer , Baltazar Garzon , is handling a series of cases in different European courts " he said .
And he felt that " if Britain says no to the safe-conduct pass , it's over . "
And if Sweden , as its legislation perfectly well allows it to do , and as it has done in other cases , questions Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London , or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow , this problem is over .
Correa took the opportunity to reassert himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stated that what he does not tolerate is " the mediocrity , dishonesty and lies that undermine the freedom of expression . "
" The greatest enemies of the press freedom are not evil and wicked politicians , but bad journalists depending on profit , blackmail and extortion " he said .
In that regard , he welcomed the fact that it was no longer these journalists , " or the bankers or bourgeois and hegemonic countries that dominate Ecuador " and said that , if re-elected , he will " step up the revolution to continue on the same path and in the right direction . "
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in UNASUR , at least until their next elections , arguing that the body " must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and a coup masked with legality " because this will in fact " destroy the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy . "
The Ecuadorian President also considered the " perfectly pertinent " desire of his Colombian counterpart , Juan Manuel Santos , to now negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundary between the two countries , after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague , in favour Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty .
For now that ruling is not being followed .
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American one .
Conflict is inevitable , but must be overcome by the desire to walk together .
They need to be processed in a comprehensive manner to overcome them and move forward .
Additionally , he trusted in a sound conclusion to the maritime boundary dispute opposing Peru and Chile in the same court and said that " it is right for Latin America to refer to international courts if both countries agree to accept losing , however hard it may be . "
With reference to the possibility of his standing as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador seeking a third consecutive term , he said he sees that possibility " with much optimism and joy , although at times it is pretty hard . "
Correa said that if he loses the elections in February 2013 , he will retire from public life .
Personally , I've never been interested in power , but in situations as unjust as those in Ecuador , socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power .
" My political movement believed that it was me who ensured that probable victory , so we have to accept that responsibility " he said .
If I won , it would be my last period in office and then I would leave public life .
If I lose , likewise .
" It's a decision " he confirmed .
Correa also referred to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's new health treatment in Cuba .
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President NicolÃ¡s Maduro and he tells me that Chavez went for treatment that was already planned , routine treatment , and it was expected he would win the campaign and return to Cuba .
" This does not mean a health relapse for President Chavez " he said .
In Lima today , the Ecuadorian Head of State attended the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations ( UNASUR ) , which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress , equality and security .
Deaths caused by AIDS are nowadays due to late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when they confirmed his test result : HIV positive .
" It was like a bomb dropped on me " he says , recalling the time of the announcement , which the doctor was trying to make " softer , " apparently unsuccessfully .
The boy hid it from his family .
He decided to care for his illness alone and began to learn about it ; thanks to his efforts he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday .
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital ( CHG ) , where he arrived in 1994 after several battles with his health .
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) for 22 years , hard to imagine in the early '90s , when there were many questions , few treatment options and a great deal of stigma .
Then , even the director of an IMSS [Mexican Social Security Institute] clinic refused to discharge him " because he had a cut . "
At that time , having Aids was synonymous with death .
Now it is possible to survive the syndrome and do so with quality of life .
However , many people are still unaware of their illness , and only seek help when the virus has already caused havoc , " exhausted " their immune systems and they are suffering from opportunistic infections .
31 years after of the onset of AIDS around the world , at least since the first reported cases , " the great achievement at this time is that the life expectancy of patients starting treatment in good time and the life expectancy of the general population is exactly equal " stated the head of the CHG HIV Unit , Jaime Andrade Villanueva , saying that this information was endorsed in April this year in a prestigious scientific journal .
Infectious disease specialist and expert in HIV/AIDS , Andrade Villanueva said that since 2008 scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a death sentence , but that life expectancy and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system that patients present when they are diagnosed , with a higher life expectancy for non-drug users : up to 30 years for patients with a 200 CD4 count and 50 years for those reporting a 500 CD4 count .
In simple terms , this means that anyone diagnosed HIV positive at 25 years old , under these terms and " as long as they keep it under control , can live with no problems to 75 " said the interviewee .
To gauge this progress , it should be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years .
Although mortality has dropped significantly in recent years and , in the case of Mexico , the number of people dying of AIDS has fallen from 6 , 678 in 2007 to 4 , 862 in 2011 ( UNAIDS annual report ) , it is also true that since the advent of AIDS , 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died .
In Jalisco alone , only 255 people died in 2011 , and there have been 187 deaths up to May of this year ; however , we are assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005 .
- Why are do still deaths occur ?
- I think the problem is not to do with access to treatment .
That's how I view it , and that's how it's been at our hospital .
For at least the last 12 years we've had no shortage of medicine , the problem is that patients arrive in an advanced state of illness because they are unaware of their HIV status , that is to say , the later stages of the disease .
He gave a compelling statistic : " Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection , so what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and , therefore , offer mass detection tests for everyone who needs them . "
Specialists and officials of the State Council of AIDS Prevention in Jalisco ( COESIDA ) agree on this proposal , as do the patients themselves , such as Fabrizio , who came to be tested at a private laboratory , motivated only because a friend had done so and , despite his young age , he was around in the AIDS era and had even suffered Kaposi sarcoma , a cancerous tumour that is one of the common complications .
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS .
Some people think they're going to die and don't want to know anything .
" If I'm going to die , I'd rather have a blow-out three times a week " they say , but not in my case .
The change was for the better ; I eat well , I exercise , I take my drugs .
To date , his parents are only aware he had cancer .
I live as normal a life as anyone else .
" I work , I take part in a lot of activities , I travel , I have an active but responsible sex life , I take care of myself and the other person " said Fabrizio , who agreed to share his intimate secrets with MILENIO JALISCO , to motivate those people with his story who today , in the context of World AIDS Day , are afraid .
They should get tested if they are at risk . because the sooner they know if they are HIV positive , the better , and if they have already been diagnosed , they must learn to live like any other person , while being responsible .
This is his message , which summarises the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012 .
Condoms behind the counter .
The gaps between health programmes and ordinary citizens are huge , said Ricardo Salazar , a journalist from Guadalajara who has taken up the HIV cause .
And the greatest cure is prevention .
In places dedicated to this task " the distribution of condoms has actually increased ; previously , they used to give us one or two , now they give us packets of a hundred , and that's fine , but it turns out there are still people out there who have no access condoms " he said .
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers .
" Why do you want them ? " is a common question , asked with sarcasm and judged according to the values of social workers , counsellors , pharmacy workers and healthcare staff who do not want to expose teenagers to sex , said the speaker .
It was decided to change such inefficient allocation , and that condoms should not only be placed behind counters , but that packets of one hundred should be found in public toilet dispensers in places frequented by young people .
This is not promoting promiscuity .
It is not about paying for their beers or motel fees , as Governor Emilio Gonzalez said , when asked if there would be distribution of condoms during his administration .
" And it's not about sexuality , but it is best to provide condoms to those already practising sexual activity " he said .
Jalisco key points
There are 13 , 435 cumulative cases ( 12 , 158 AIDS and 1 , 317 HIV ) .
The state is 4th in the nation in new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV .
92% of new infections are through sex , 6% via the bloodstream and 2% perinatal .
An estimated 50 , 000 people may be living with HIV , as for each registered case there are around 4-5 people who do not know they are positive .
Ratified by a United States court of appeal , a judgement which ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt achieved via a bankruptcy in Mexico , the scenario is an ominous precedent for any national company with offices in the neighbouring country that has solvency problems .
It seems , then , that the proceedings in support of survival of firms permit Mexican law are not valid in the land of stars and stripes , contrary to international conventions .
In practical terms , the endorsement of the judgement delivered on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court of the Northern District of Texas , leaves Mexican firms defenceless against possible seizure of their property outside of Mexico .
However , the decision opens the door for the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States , claiming three inconsistencies .
From the start , while the trial judge notes that creditors should be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Code , the Court of Appeal for the Fifth Circuit , based in New Orleans , states that the main action is the insolvency action handled in Mexico .
The first point would involve ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with transnational profiles .
Indeed , the UN Model Law for International Trade Law Uniformity was created for this purpose , with the American Law Institute positioned as arbitrator .
Secondly , the judgement establishes that without the intercompany vote , with the debts the Vitro subsidiaries had with their parent company recognised in the critical mass of the insolvency , the majority needed to approve the restructuring might not be achieved .
However , Mexican law recognises the possibility .
In fact , the Vitro case was not the first one in which the scheme was accepted .
There are half a dozen examples , including Agremex and Commercial Mexicana , whose intercompany debts were endorsed by the Federal Bankruptcy Institute .
What is also certain is that , not including the votes of subsidiaries , the Vitro creditors who fought against it in the US courts , namely " vulture " funds such as Aurelios Capital , Aurelios Convergence , Elliot International and Liverpool Limited , did not achieve a majority .
The vote was apparently 45 percent versus 37 .
This data is omitted by the Court of Appeal .
From another perspective , the latter blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 , while trying to avoid the severe economic crisis faced by the United States , turning its back on the country .
For now , the Gonzalez Sada family firm has lodged a motion for reconsideration before the Court of Appeal for the vote to reach the plenary of the court , that is , the five judges , given that only three voted previously .
Should this fail , an appeal for review by a higher court , in this case the US Supreme Court , will be filed .
The real problem is that the court bypassed a document sent by the Government of Mexico in the capacity of amicus curiae ( " friend of the Court " ) , which details the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Commercial Insolvency Law , noting that the latter discharged itself with adherence to the agreements signed by the two countries to link it with Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Act of the United States .
Moreover , it should be noted that the country yielded to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade , that is the rules set for cross-border insolvency cases , ensuring fairness for debtors and creditors .
Double whammy : Vitro hit and country hit .
Balance Sheet
With the complaints put on the table by the unions of Mexicana Airlines against the former owner of the company , GastÃ³n AzcÃ¡rraga Andrade , who is accused of mismanagement , dormant for several months , the Airline Pilots Union Association already found the bottleneck .
The proceedings headed by Carlos Diaz Chavez Morineau has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission , which is accused of obstructing justice .
The claim is that the supervisory authority has consistently refused to provide reports to the Attorney General's Office on a transaction carried out by the employer to remove 198 million pesos from trust F/589 of Banco IXE , on behalf of Mexicana de AviaciÃ³n .
The resources were apparently channelled towards the purchase of shares in the company Administradora Profesional de Hoteles .
As you know , Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain .
Opposing Dragon Mart
A group of local and foreign environmentalists , academics , businessmen and members of the public gathered at the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean to approve the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun .
As you know , we are talking about a huge sales and distribution centre in Mexico , Central America and the Caribbean , selling Chinese products , with a residential area at the bottom for employees of 150 companies .
Previously , Canacintra had managed to unite the governors of the southeast of Mexico to oppose the monumental building that destroyed part of a protected area and represents the mother of all threats to industry .
The death of ACTA
The Government ignored an order of the Senate to explain under what terms and conditions the Mexican Ambassador in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement , known by its acronym ACTA , according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property , and the matter has already been archived .
As you know , the action was taken even though the Senate had ruled out the possibility , deeming it an infringement of freedom of expression on social networks .
Homex long term
In effort to repay long-term debt without affecting short-term debt , the housing developer Homex is placing securities exchange certificates on the market for 500 million pesos .
The issue is the first of four identical issues which are offering to repay interest every 28 days .
Birth of Competival
A consortium under the name Competival has just been established , comprising the companies NYCE , e-Quality and Kernet , leaders in information technology , the objective of which will be to market the services of software clusters in Central and South America .
Investments in this area exceed USD 1 . 5 billion .
Hector " Hetin " Reyes : " Basketball has been my life "
Basketball globetrotter Hector " Hetin " Reyes was involved in the sport for over 60 years and , thanks to it , travelled the world .
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental recollection of local basketball history as broad as that of HÃ©ctor " Hetin " Reyes .
Reyes was immersed in the sport for over 60 years before being confined to a wheelchair in 2008 following a stroke ; he was a minor league player , National Superior Basketball player , BSN representative and manager with the BayamÃ³n Vaqueros or President of the Basketball Federation .
" I wore lots of hats in basketball throughout my life , including several at the same time , like when I was president of the BSN , general manager and federative president of the National Team during the '90s , " recalled Reyes during Primera Hora's visit to his home in BayamÃ³n , where he lives with Isabel , his loyal wife for over 50 years .
" Basketball has been my life . "
Reyes is not exaggerating when he makes that statement .
The walls of his house are almost totally decorated with pictures and memorabilia denoting his long career , which goes to prove it .
BayamÃ³n at heart
Of them all , the ones he treasures with the most emotion are the ones that remind him of his time spent with the Vaqueros , from the mid-50s as a player until 1982 , when he completed 15 years serving as co-agent or agent of the franchise .
" Those were my best years , the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of the Vaqueros' eight championships , since 1967 , either as agent , co-agent or manager .
There were many good years , including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975 .
And then I said goodbye with one in 1981 , Jerome Mincy's debut year in the BSN .
Then " Cuco " Ortiz took over - he was a great manager " said Reyes .
I remember that Gene Bartow , who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama ( Birmingham ) , said to me 'I've got a very strong player for you , 6'7 " tall .
Do you want him ? '
And that was the beginning of Mincy , one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had .
Bartow then recommended the sharpshooter Gausse Raymond , who established residency here and was one of our best shooters .
I remember him saying that if Mincy had given Bayamon one championship , Gausse would help get another .
The Vaqueros' championship with Gausse was enjoyed , but from a distance , because in 1988 he was already becoming a federative bigshot .
For that time , he preferred to enjoy his own and Mincy's accomplishments in the national team .
I remember when we beat the United States for the first time during the 1989 Pre-Olympics in Mexico .
Then came the 1990 World Cup , where we came fourth and it should have been bronze , but for the Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time , said Reyes .
Is the 1990 World National Team the best you've ever seen ?
It's one of the best , as good as the one that beat the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics .
However , my favourite was the one in the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba , when we won gold and gave the US team a beating , which was quite similar to the time we won bronze at the World Cup .
That team not only again included Mincy , Gausse , Ramon Rivas , Fico LÃ³pez and 'PiculÃ­n' ( Ortiz ) , but also the young ( Javier ) 'ToÃ±ito' ColÃ³n and James Carter , the Leon brothers ( Francisco and Edgar ) and Mario 'Quijote' Morales , who was kept out of the 90 team by a knee injury .
A team that maybe was not the best in terms of members , but which gave us a gold medal and was a great joy to work with , was the 1995 Pre-Olympic team in Neuquen , Argentina .
With role players such as 'Canito' Nieves , Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended after the shambles of the Mar del Plata Pan-American Games , we won gold against all the odds .
Who was the best Puerto Rican player ?
Without any doubt , PiculÃ­n Ortiz .
His numbers at international tournament level are awesome .
Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level like PiculÃ­n did .
Not to mention his career in the various leagues he played in .
Who was the best Puerto Rican manager ?
That's a difficult one .
We had a very good team , including Julio Toro , Flor Melendez , Carlos Morales , Raymond Dalmau , Armandito Torres .
Of the youngsters , I really like the work of Leo Arill .
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation ?
Having been part of the National Team's most glorious era between 1988 and 1995 and in the early 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season .
What was there left for you to do ?
There were things I'd have liked to implement , such as regionalising the minor leagues .
For example , the boys of Ponce only play in their area and only get to face teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs .
Right now the kids are riding and playing too much , unnecessarily .
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and a course for leaders , table officials and referees .
That pleases me .
What are you doing now ?
The most I do is listen to music , watch music videos from my era on YouTube , enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games .
And of course , enjoy the company of my wife , Elizabeth , who has always been with me .
Actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman , born on 21 September 1931 in Fort Worth ( Texas ) , became world famous for his role as John Ross Ewing , better known as " JR , " in the television series " Dallas , " in which he played a ruthless , malicious and manipulative businessman .
Larry Hagman , whose role as oil tycoon predator JR Ewing in the television series " Dallas " became a symbol of greed in the 1980s , has died .
He was 81 .
Hagman , who returned this year as JR in a new season of " Dallas , " died on Friday afternoon of cancer complications , according to a family statement provided to the Associated Press by the Warner Bros . , producer of " Dallas . "
" Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas , once again representing the iconic role he most liked " the family said .
Larry's family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving Day holiday .
Linda Gray , who played his wife in the original series and the sequel , was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas , said her publicist , Jeffrey Lane .
He brought joy to all who knew him .
He was creative , generous , funny , loving and talented , and I will miss him dearly .
" He was an original guy and lived life to the full " said Gray in a statement .
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and admitted that he had drunk a lot over the years .
In 1995 a malignant tumour as found in his liver and he underwent a transplant .
Years before " Dallas , " Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy " I Dream of Jeannie , " aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970 .
He played Captain Tony Nelson , an astronaut whose life is changed when he meets an attractive genie , played by Barbara Eden , and takes her home to live with him .
He also starred in two sitcoms that were not aired for long , " The Good Life " ( NBC , 1971-72 ) and " Here We Go Again " ( ABC , 1973 ) .
His film work included roles well received by critics in " The Group , " " Harry and Tonto " and " Primary Colors . "
But it was his masterful interpretation of delightfully detestable JR that led to Hagman reaching his peak of stardom .
The drama series on CBS about the Ewing clan and other characters in their orbit aired from April 1978 to May 1991 .
The tagline " Who shot JR ? , " designed to generate hype around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is nearly killed , generated international speculation and millions of risky dollars wagered in gaming establishments .
It also helped give the series a record audience at the time .
When the answer was revealed in an episode in November 1980 , an average of 41 million viewers tuned in and made " Dallas " the second most watched entertainment programme in history , after the final episode of " MASH " in 1983 , which had 50 million viewers .
It was JR's sister-in-law Kristin ( played by Mary Crosby ) who shot him .
JR got her pregnant then threatened to say she was a prostitute unless she left town , but there were others who also had reasons to attack him .
Hagman portrayed Ewing as a corrupt insatiable man with a charismatic smile : a dishonest entrepreneur and cheating husband who tried to have his alcoholic wife , Sue Ellen ( Linda Gray ) , sectioned .
" I know what I want on JR's tombstone " Hagman said in 1988 .
It should read : " Here lies the honest citizen JR Ewing . "
This is the only deal he lost .
Victoria Principal , co-star of the original series , recalled Hagman on Friday as someone " huge , on and off screen . "
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable , for millions of fans around the world , and in the hearts of each one of us who was fortunate enough to know and love him .
Ten episodes of the new edition of " Dallas " were broadcast a few months ago with great success for TNT .
He had already finished recording five episodes for the second series and a sixth was in process , the chain reported .
Immediately after , there was no statement from Warner or TNT about how the series would handle the loss of Hagman .
Hagman , born in Fort Worth , Texas , was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin , who starred in classics such as " South Pacific " and " Peter Pan . "
Martin was still a teenager when she had him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman .
He tried his luck in the New York theatre scene in the early '50s , and later served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 , in England .
While there , he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her .
The couple had two sons , Preston and Heidi , and lived for a long time in the Californian city Malibu , home to many celebrities .
In 2001 , he called his memoirs " Hello Darlin' : Tall ( and Absolutely True ) Tales About My Life . "
" I didn't put anything in it that I believed would hurt anyone or affect them in any way " he told Associated Press at the time .
After his liver transplant , he became an organ donation promoter and worked as a volunteer at a hospital , helping fearful patients .
" I advise them , encourage them , meet with them when they come for their surgery , and afterwards " he said in 1996 .
I try to offer some comfort , such as " Don't be afraid , it will be a little uncomfortable for a short time , but then you'll be fine . "
He was also an anti-smoking activist and took part in several campaigns .
Start of a course that explores the " End of the World "
Each week , students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war , zombies , viruses and germs , and global warming .
This term , when Professor of religion , Stuart CharmÃ© , decided to give a course on the end of the world , he knew he had a compelling hook : The end of the " long countdown " of the Mayan calendar , 21 December , which had convinced many people that the end of the world was coming .
But CharmÃ© had no idea what awaited him over the next couple of months : The cataclysmic hurricane Sandy , a fiscal precipice some called " debt Armageddon " and a growing conflict involving Israel , where end-of-the-world Christians theorists think the Apocalypse will begin .
" I didn't realise this was going to be the most apocalyptic term ever " said CharmÃ© this week to students at Rutgers-Camden University ( New Jersey ) .
If you look at what has been happening in the world today as if we were at 30 days and counting , this has been a really good period .
And remember that bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mentality .
And he is not the only professor who offers courses on the " end of the world " this term , theoretically the last in history .
At Temple , Associate Professor Barry Vacker is giving the course " Media , Culture and the end of the world . "
Each week , students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war , zombies , viruses and germs , and global warming .
" We looked at why these ideas proliferate over time " he said , and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide human behaviour .
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists , for example , a war could break out .
This month students analysed movies with an apocalyptic theme and explored how they compare with real-life examples .
" I've tried to inform students about what is possible , probable , credible and impossible " said Vacker .
At the main Pennsylvania State University campus , Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall , and his colleague Amara Solari , an Associate Art History and Anthropology Professor , have teamed up to give a course , called simply " The end of the world . "
" We don't add '2012' so we always have the option of running the course again , if the world doesn't come to an end " said Restall .
Despite the " impending doom , " students have to study , undertake projects and take final exams .
At Penn State , the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse , which leaves students no choice but to work " until the very night the world is supposed to end " said Restall .
The courses proved quite popular .
" It was fully booked within two hours " said Restall , on his course for students with high averages , which was filled with 35 students .
We received emails for weeks and weeks before the start of the term , from people asking if there were any places .
Students , meanwhile , say the course is one of the most interesting around .
" I find it fascinating to see what people do to console themselves " said Bridgid Robinson , a 23-year-old post-graduate Religion and Sociology student from Haddonfield , New Jersey , at Rutgers-Camden .
And the apocalyptic , secular or religious mentality is just a matter consolation or a lack of it .
Will Wekesa , a 25-year-old post-graduate Psychology and Nursing student , said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies .
" I'd never heard of a class that could teach it " he said .
I enjoy it .
But none of the students interviewed - much less any professor - said they believed in the end date of December 21st .
" Our first project was about the Mayan prophecy and to a certain extent we discredited it " said Julie Zeglen , a 21-year-old final year student at Temple , from West Chester .
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world : it is just a key point in the calendar , said Restall .
But he said that Western culture suffers from apocalyptic anxiety , which goes back several centuries , in which people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world .
The Internet has caused a boom in these speculations .
" In other places , people don't think about it " he said .
It's mostly in the English-speaking world .
Joseph Dougherty , a Professor of religion at La Salle University , who is giving courses in the Philippines this year , responded quickly to the question of whether he knew about any courses on the " end of the world " there .
" The Philippines are not taking part in the end of the world " he wrote , suggesting an exception of a higher authority .
We have an indulgence from the Pope .
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the last judgement , and said that if nothing happens on December 21st , " people will immediately start thinking of the next date " or philosophising that December 21st is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end .
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly .
Some said they plan to go to " end of the world " parties .
" Maybe I'll call some friends so we can have a laugh together " said Samira Ford , 20-year-old communications student .
